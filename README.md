# Tunnistamo

## Set up with Docker

1. Create a `docker-compose.env.yaml` file in the project folder:
   * you can use `docker-compose.env.yaml.template` as a base, it does not need any changes if you want all features enables
   * change `DEBUG` and the rest of the Django settings if needed
   * set entrypoint/startup variables according to taste
     * `SETUP_DEV_OIDC`, creates a working OIDC environment
     * `CREATE_SUPERUSER`, creates a superuser with credentials `admin`:`admin` (admin@example.com)
     * `APPLY_MIGRATIONS`, applies migrations on startup
     * `GENERATE_OPENID_KEY`, generates a RSA key on startup

2. Run `docker-compose up`
   
The project is now running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Set up w/o Docker

### Prerequisites

Tunnistamo runs on postresql. Install the server on Debian based systems with:
```
apt install postgresql
```

Then create a postgres user and db as root:
```
createuser <your username>
createdb -O <your username> tunnistamo
```


### Installing
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/City-of-Helsinki/tunnistamo.git
cd tunnistamo
```

Initiate a virtualenv and install the Python requirements:
```
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.10 tunnistamo-env
pyenv local tunnistamo-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may choose some other Python version to install but currently Tunnistamo
requires Python 3.

Create `local_settings.py` in the repo base dir containing the following line:
```
DEBUG = True
```

In case you want to modify the default database configurations, you may also
modify them in the same file by adding these lines:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'custom_database',
        'USER': 'custom_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
    }
}
```

Run migrations:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Create admin user:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Create RSA keys:
```
python manage.py manage_openid_keys
```
> In order to automatically rotate the server RSA key at set intervals the above command should be added to `cron.daily`.

Run dev server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
and login to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ using the admin user credentials.

To access the themed views you also need to install
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and run
`npm install` at the project root.

## Developing

### Outdated Python dependencies
Tunnistamo uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
to manage the Python dependencies.

Update the requirements with:
```
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
pip-compile --upgrade requirements-dev.in
pip-compile --upgrade requirements-prod.in
```

## Configuring

### Client IP obtaining

Tunnistamo uses [django-ipware](https://github.com/un33k/django-ipware) to obtain
client ip addresses for user login history entries. By default, a client ip address
is read from `REMOTE_ADDR`. If you need to use some HTTP header(s) instead,
for instance when deploying Tunnistamo behind a reverse proxy, use setting
`IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER` to set the header(s), for example:
```python
IPWARE_META_PRECEDENCE_ORDER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR',)
```

### Getting geo location data for IP addresses

In order to get geo location data for IP addresses, which is in included user login 
history entries if available, you'll need GeoLite2 City dataset in binary format
from [here](http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City-CSV.zip).
Unzip it to somewhere (inside this repo `/data/` is the preferred place as that
is in `.gitignore`), and add setting `GEOIP_PATH` pointing to that directory.

See [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/geoip2/)
for more info.

### Rotating server RSA keys with Key Manager

For added security the server RSA keys, used to sign/encrypt ID tokens, should be rotated at regular intervals. This can be done automatically with the Django admin utility `manage_openid_keys` provided in the Key Manager module. This utility performs the following tasks:

1. If there are no server RSA keys one is created with `KEY_MANAGER_RSA_KEY_LENGTH` bits (default 4096).
2. If an RSA key is older than `KEY_MANAGER_RSA_KEY_MAX_AGE` days the key is expired and a new one is created.
   * This happens also for all existing keys not recognized by the Key Manager
3. If an RSA key has been expired over `KEY_MANAGER_RSA_KEY_EXPIRATION_PERIOD` days ago it is removed from the system.

This command should be run on production servers at regular intervals, e.g. once a day, using `cron` or similar tool.

See [OIDC_provider docs](https://django-oidc-provider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/serverkeys.html) for more information about server RSA keys.


### Configuring Suomi.fi access levels

Suomi.fi authentication provider has dynamic scopes and claims based on access levels and attributes configured in a YAML file. The default YAML file, `suomifi_fields.yaml`, has configurations for _suppea_, _keskilaaja_ and _laaja_ access levels. The resulting OIDC scopes will be _suomifi_suppea_, _suomifi_keskilaaja_ and _suomifi_laaja_, respectively. The claims these scopes provide are maps with the _friendlyName_ of the Suomi.fi attribute as key and the value of that attribute as value.

The YAML file can be processed using command:
```
python manage.py populate_suomifi_attributes --load suomifi_fields.yaml
```
